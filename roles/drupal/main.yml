##Since, Drupal is currently in the root directory, let us copy the folder
##and move it into the default httpd directory:
#cp -r ~/cp -r ~/drupal-8.0.0/* /var/www/html
- name: Copy html
#  shell: cp -r ~/cp -r ~/drupal-8.0.0/* /var/www/html
  copy:
    src: /home/flamez97/drupal-8.0.0/
    dest: /var/www/html/

##Now to finalize the configurations on the servers side, we must change the
##create a settings file in the sites default directory. Letâ€™s change to that
##directory with the following command:
#cd /var/www/html/sites/default/
##Copy the default.settings.php file and rename it to settings.php with the
##following command:
#cp -p default.settings.php settings.php

- name: copy settings.php
  copy:
    src: "{{ php_settings }}"
    dest: " {{ php_dest }}"
    mode: 666

##We need to modify the permissions so that the Drupal installer can edit
#  chmod 666 settings.php
##We also need to make a files directory, do so with the following command:
#mkdir files
##Modify the permissions of files with the following command:
#chmod 777 files
- name: Create Files Dir
  file:
    name: "{{ default_file }}"
    state: present
    mode: 777

##We need to restart Apache since we installed the PHP extensions.
#systemctl restart httpd.service
- name: Restart Apache
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restart

##If you run into issues installing drupal;
##The pdo erro can be solved running: sudo yum install php-mysql(php56w-mysql)
##The /default/file/ being ynreadable can be solved using: chown Apache

##We should also set the processes to run automatically when the server boots
##(php will run automatically once Apache starts):

- name: Configure httpd
  shell: chkconfig httpd on

- name: Configure mysqld
  shell: chkconfig mysqld on
